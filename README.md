# Filament demo - 3D printer objects

A demo app showcasing how to use [Filament](https://google.github.io/filament) to easily integrate 3D models into a Compose Android application.

The app was the base for a presentation I gave in 2024 and the order of commits reflects the increasing complexity of aspects described in the presentation.
